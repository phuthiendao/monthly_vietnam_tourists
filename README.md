# monthly_vietnam_tourists
This project focuses on the analysis and forecasting of monthly time series data on the number of international tourists arriving in Vietnam from 2013 to 2024. The dataset spans from January 2013 to December 2024 and includes four main columns representing different modes of entry. The data is sourced from the Vietnam National Authority of Tourism website:https://vietnamtourism.gov.vn/statistic/international

Cruise: Tourists arriving by cruise ships
Road: Tourists entering via land borders
Aviation: Tourists arriving by air
All: Total number of tourists (sum of all modes)
To gain deeper insights into tourism trends over time, we apply both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. Additionally, potential issues such as missing values, seasonality, and outliers are handled through appropriate preprocessing and imputation techniques to ensure data quality and model performance.

Finally, various time series forecasting models are implemented to predict monthly tourist arrivals for the year 2025, segmented by each mode of entry. The results of this project can provide valuable insights for decision-making in tourism planning and development in Vietnam.
